    "Gender pay gap is a ubiquitously known problem of the modern world. Reports indicate that \"... in 2024, women earned an average of 85% of what men earned...([REF](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/03/04/gender-pay-gap-in-us-has-narrowed-slightly-over-2-decades/))\". Although the gap has been decreasing steadily, the changes have been slow, with \"... businesses having a long way to go to reach gender equality...([REF](https://www.skillcast.com/blog/gender-equality-gender-pay-gap-reporting))\". \n",
    "\n",
    "In this project and report, I take a closer look at this phenomenon in an attempt to quantify the gap and raise clarity and awareness among women. I hope this empowers women to speak up for themselves and demand equal treatment as their male counterparts.\n",

    "# 1. Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The data I picked to explore comes from [Wages By Education](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asaniczka/wages-by-education-in-the-usa-1973-2022) from Kaggle, encompassing the hourly salary data for various demographic groups and educational backgrounds between the years of 1973 and 2022. \n",

    "# 2. Data Wrangling and EDA\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the source of the data, it is pretty clean with no `null` values or mismatchmed datatypes, etc. Therefore, it required minimum wrangling ([Wrangling Notebook](https://github.com/nazilagundogdu/GenderPayGap/blob/main/1.%20DataWrangling.ipynb)). However, some adjustments, such as reshaping the data was necessary for the EDA ([EDA Notebook](https://github.com/nazilagundogdu/GenderPayGap/blob/main/2.%20EDA.ipynb)).\n",
    "\n",
    "The following boxplots show the average pay disparity between male and female workforce (on the left), and broken down by education level (on the right). One can see that women are underpaid at every educational level.\n",

    "The issue is exacerbated when we consider race as a factor too, with white people being paid more than their black or hispanic counteroarts, overall. We can see the pay trends for the 49 years of data, which show the gap for different educational levels between racial demographics. Note that this data is for men only. But, we see the same trend, albeit less drastic for women of different races. \n",

    "The data has a mixture of categorical and numerical values. To handle the categorical data, I used \"one-hot\" coding or `get_dummies()` method of `Pandas`. I also reshaped the data from a wide format to a long format. I compared three modeling algorithms (two with tuning as well- so 5 in total) for this dataset, whose results you see below. \n",

    "- To begin with, one can work on a non-cleaned real world data from sources other than Kaggle\n",
    "- Comparison between different countries of similar wealth and status can reveal interesting insights as well\n",
    "- We can look at the data through a different lens. I used regression modeling to predict salary rates in the future. However, we can easily change this to a classification or a clustering issue trying to answer \"which demogrpahic group does person X belong to if their salary is Y and their education level is Z\"? \n",
    "- Another improvement can be brought by using GridSearch (with more parametes) instead of RandomSearch (with 20 iterations) I used here due to computational power constraints.\n",
